          <span class="white-text">My name is Phanisri Tummala, and I'm the president of the Newspaper Club! I've played a lot of roles as an actual Newspaper member, including the roles of a formatter, an editor, an advice-giver, and even a journalist! I'm glad to say that they're all fun in their own way, and they have inspired passions in me that I didn't even know were there. It's been awesome building this club from scratch, and I'm excited to see it grow and branch out even more.
I'm also extremely committed to Speech and Debate, and I love volunteering in the community.

 I will be helping the journalists choose their roles and aid them in writing if needed. I was an active member in Newspaper Club last year and am grateful to be an officer this year. In my spare time, I love photography and designing, as well as blogging!
 I’m also the Public Relations officer for the GSA, which advocates for helping LGBT students and providing a safe space for them.

I'm currently in the EVHS Wind Ensemble as a flutist and I've been playing piano since I was in the second grade. I truly believe that pictures speak a thousand words and that they add essential flair to the newspaper, making it seem less intimidating to read with all its words. I love being apart of the newspaper club and I KNOW we're going to have a fantastic year! :)
